In this paper we discussed conventional approaches to building
sequential recommender systems and implemented BERT4Rec and LSTM-based models for two type of tasks in 
sequentail recommendation: Relevance Prediction and Next Item Prediction. The usage of these models
allowed to make use of sequential context, that is extremely important to simultaneously model the short-term interest of
users in the session. Moreover, the usage of these models resulted in overall 0.5% increase in the quality of recommendations.
